I spend much of my time away from school listening to music or watching movies. this page provides lists of my favorite albums and films from each year. the criteria for inclusion is as follows: an album must be released within the listed calender year. a film must have US theatrical (or digital for streaming-only films) release during the listed calendar year. albums and movies for each year are listed alphabetically.
