Hi and welcome. :)

I am Austin Ellingworth. I am a PhD candidate in the Colorado State University Statistics Department under the tutelage Professor [Wen Zhou](https://wp.nyu.edu/rczw/). My dissertation research focuses on reproducibility and its applications in high-throughput experimentation. Additionally, I am interested in undergraduate research and statistical applications in sports and genomics. 

Prior to CSU, I recieved a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Statistics from Winona State University.
