Hi and welcome. :)

I am Austin Ellingworth. I am a PhD candidate in the Colorado State University Statistics Department. My research focuses on reproducibility and its applications in high-throughput genomics. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Wen Zhou](https://wp.nyu.edu/rczw/).

I am interested in undergraduate statistics education and statistical applications in sports and high-throughput genomics.
