As a feline statistician, my research interests span a variety of topics related to cat behavior, health, and well-being. Below are some examples of my recent research projects:

## A Bayesian Approach to Modeling Catnip Preference

- This study developed a Bayesian hierarchical model to better understand the individual and environmental factors that influence a cat's preference for catnip. Our results suggest that age, sex, and the presence of other cats in the household are important predictors of catnip preference.
## DeepCAT: A Deep Learning Framework for Cat Image Classification

- This study proposed a deep learning framework called DeepCAT for automated classification of cat images. Our model achieved state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset, demonstrating the potential of deep learning for cat-related image analysis.
## Feline Regression Models for Mouse Hunting: A Comparative Study

- This study compared the performance of different regression models in predicting a cat's mouse hunting behavior. Our results showed that a Bayesian regression model with adaptive priors outperformed other models in terms of predictive accuracy.


My research has been published in top-tier statistical and computational journals, including the Journal of the American Statistical Association and the Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning.
